Machine Learning Projects – Summer 2022 (GoMyCode Training)
This repository contains code developed during a Machine Learning training program I completed at GoMyCode in the summer of 2022.

While the code may not fully reflect professional standards, it holds personal significance as it represents the beginning of my journey into programming and artificial intelligence. I’ve chosen to preserve it in its original state out of nostalgia and as a reminder of how far I’ve come.

Note: The code is not fully optimized or polished, but it remains a meaningful part of my learning experience.
